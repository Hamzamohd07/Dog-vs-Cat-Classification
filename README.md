## Dog VS Cat Classification
Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats.

**Data Preprocessing:**  
- *Data Collection:* Use a labeled dataset of dog and cat images (e.g., the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset).
- *Image Resizing:* Standardize image dimensions (e.g., 150x150 pixels).
- *Normalization:* Scale pixel values to the range [0, 1].
- *Data Augmentation:* Apply techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming to increase dataset diversity.

**Model Design:**  
- *Input Layer:* Images resized to the chosen dimensions.
- *Convolutional Layers:* Several convolutional layers with filters to extract features, followed by activation functions (e.g., ReLU).
- *Pooling Layers:* Use max pooling to reduce dimensionality.
- *Fully Connected Layers:* Dense layers to make predictions.
- *Output Layer:* Single neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification (dog or cat).

**Training:**  
- *Loss Function:* Binary cross-entropy.
- *Optimizer:* Adam or SGD.
- *Epochs:* Set an appropriate number to ensure convergence.
- *Batch Size:* Choose based on available computational resources.



**Tools:**  
- *Language:* Python
- *Libraries:* TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy
